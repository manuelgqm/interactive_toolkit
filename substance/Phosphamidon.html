		<h3>Neurotoxic</h3><p>
			<b>Effect:</b>CHOLINERGIC: Stimulated or transmitted by acetylcholine.
Applies to parasympathetic nerve endings.
There are changes in the state of consciousness, muscle weakness and excessive secretory activity.
<p>
			<b>Level:</b> 2: Neurotoxic substances causing measurable biochemical alterations (e.g., at neurotransmitters or activity of enzymes level).<p>

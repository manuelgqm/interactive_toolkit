	<h2>Health effects</h2>
	<h3>Carcinogen</h3><p>
<b>ACCORDING TO GHS</b><p>
<b>Carcinogen level</b> 2: Suspected human carcinogen. The placing of a substance in Category 2 is done on the basis of evidence obtained from human and/or animal studies, but which is not sufficiently convincing to place the substance in Category 1A or 1B, based on strength of evidence together with additional considerations. Such evidence may be derived either from limited (1) evidence of carcinogenicity in human studies or from limited evidence of carcinogenicity in animal studies.<p>
<b>ACCORDING TO IARC</b><p>
<b>Group:</b>2B: Possibly carcinogenic to humans<p>
<b>Volume:</b> (VOL. 20, SUPL. 7; 1987)<p>

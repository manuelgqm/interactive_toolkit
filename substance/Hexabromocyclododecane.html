	<h2>Health effects</h2>
	<h3>Toxic for reproduction</h3><p>
		
<b>ACCORDING TO GHS</b><p>
<b>Category</b> 2: Substances which cause concern for human fertility: This concern is generally based on: results in appropriate animal studies which provide sufficient evidence to cause a strong suspicion of impaired fertility in the absence of toxic effects, or evidence of impaired fertility occuring at approximately the same dose levels as other toxic effects, but that it is a non-specific secondary consequence of other toxic effects, but where the evidence is insufficient to place the substance in Category 2, other relevant data (Substances with R62)<p>

Substances which cause concern for humans owing to possible developmental toxic effects: This concern is generally based on: results from appropriate animal studies which provide sufficient evidence to cause a strong suspicion of developmental toxicity in the absence of signs of marked toxicity the mother, or at about the same dose levels as other toxic effects but which are not a secondary non-specific consequence of other toxic effects, but where the evidence is insufficient to place the substance in Category 2, other relevant data (substances with R63)

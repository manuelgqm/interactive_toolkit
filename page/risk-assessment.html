<h1>Step 3: Risk assessment</h1><p>

Risk assessment is a process to determine risks due to exposure to chemicals with the 4 steps:<p>
A risk assessment is a thorough look at your workplace to identify those things, situations, processes, etc that may cause harm, particularly to human health. After identification it is necessary to evaluate how likely and severe the risk is, and then decide what measures should be in place to effectively prevention or control.<p>
<ol>
<li><b>Hazard identification</b><br>
A hazard is any source of potential damage, harm or adverse health effects on something or someone under certain conditions at work.<p>
Hazards can come from a wide range of sources. General examples include any substance, material, process, practice, etc that has the ability to cause harm or adverse health effect to a person under certain conditions (Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and safety). <p>
Hazard identification is based on the determination of substances of concern, the adverse effects they may have inherently on target systems under certain conditions of exposure, taking into account toxicity data <p>
Hazard identification involves ask the question: which chemical? Is it hazardous to man or environment (classification, labelling)<p>

<li><b>Hazard characterisation</b><br>
    Description of the nature of the hazard associated with the chemical agent, based on one or more elements, such as mechanisms of action involved, biological extrapolation, dose-response and dose-effect relationships, and their respective attendant uncertainties<p>
Hazard characterization involves ask the questions: what are the key hazards? Problematic endpoints (carcinogen mutagen)?
</li>
<li><b>Exposure assessment (whole life cycle!)</b><br>
    EPA defines exposure as 'contact between an agent and the visible exterior of a person (e.g. skin and openings into the body)'. Exposure assessment is the process of measuring or estimating the magnitude, frequency, and duration of human exposure to an agent in the environment, or estimating future exposures for an agent that has not yet been released.<p>

 Exposure can be measured directly, but more commonly is estimated indirectly through consideration of measured concentrations in the environment, consideration of models of chemical transport and fate in the environment, and estimates of human intake over time.<p>
Exposure assessment involves ask the questions: Which exposure occurs/  is expected (inhalation/dermal/oral) To what extend and duration?
</li>
<li><b>Risk characterisation</b><br>
    A risk characterization conveys the risk assessor's judgment as to the nature and presence or absence of risks, along with information about how the risk was assessed, where assumptions and uncertainties still exist, and where policy choices will need to be made. Risk characterization takes place in both human health risk assessments and ecological risk assessments.<p>

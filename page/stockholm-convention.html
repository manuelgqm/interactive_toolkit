<h1>The Stockholm Convention</h1><p>
<img src="img/stockholm-logo2.png" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10">The Stockholm Convention was adopted in 2001 and entered into force on May 17 2004.<p>
The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants is a global treaty to protect human health and the environment from chemicals that remain intact in the environment for long periods, become widely distributed geographically, accumulate in the fatty tissue of humans and wildlife, and have harmful impacts on human health or on the environment.<p>
Exposure to Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) can lead to serious health effects including certain cancers, birth defects, dysfunctional immune and reproductive systems, greater susceptibility to disease and damages to the central and peripheral nervous systems.<p>
The Convention seeks to eliminate or restrict the production and use of all intentionally produced POPs (ie, chemicals and manufactured by industry). Continuing education is also proposed and, where feasible, eliminate releases of unintentionally produced POP&#39;s such as dioxins and furans.
<h2>Objective</h2><p>
The objective of the Stockholm Convention is to protect human health and the environment from persistent organic pollutants.<p>
This convention requires its parties to take measures to eliminate or reduce the release of POP&#39;s into the environment.<p>

Capacity building tool for developing countries

<div class="expand" title="Stockholm Convention Training Tool on the Technical Guidelines for the Environmentally Sound Management (ESM) of Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) wastes "><p>
	The Secretariats of the Stockholm and Basel Conventions jointly designed an interactive tool to assist the parties in the understanding of guidelines and to provide a wider perspective of POP’s waste management for general consideration.<p>

	This tool includes five separate guidelines on POP’s wastes:<p>

	Guideline 1. Updated general technical guidelines for the ESM on POP’s wastes<br>
	Guideline 2. Technical guidelines on PCB’s<br>
	Guideline 3. Technical guidelines on DDT<br>
	Guideline 4.  Technical guidelines on unintentionally produced PCDD’s, PCDF’s, HCB, and PCB’s<br>
	Guideline 5.  Technical guidelines on POP pesticides<br><p>
	Target audience includes persons involved in the management of POP wastes with knowledge on these issues, such as: <p>
		<ul>
			<li>handlers of hazardous chemical wastes, treatment and destruction industries</li>
			<li>POP waste generators</li>
			<li>relevant Government regulators and trainers on hazardous waste management</li>
		</ul><p>
	In the future, training workshops will be held in developing countries, and in countries with economies in transition, in order to support relevant personnel for the implementation of technical guidelines on POPs wastes, and to consider areas that require further work for managing and eliminating wastes.
	<p>
	The training tool is available in English, French and Spanish. Please choose your language below.

<div class="expand" title="Guidance on best available techniques and best environmental practices for the use of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and related chemicals listed under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants"><p>

	Stockholm convention prohibits the use of PFOS and related chemicals except in certain applications or as intermediate in the production of chemicals used in such applications.<p>

	In a similar way, production of PFOS is allowed only for use in these applications and the production of chemicals used in them. Parties that produce and/or use PFOS must be registered with the Secretariat of the Convention and should take into account guidance on BAT and BEP. Furthermore, in 2011, the COP adopted a decision that encourages Parties to implement recommendations on risk reduction for PFOS, its salts, PFOS-F related to the different stages in the life cycle of PFOS, as well as processes and materials containing PFOS. This guidance document was developed to guide Parties in the adequate risk management of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and related substances.<p>

	According to the comments received as of 31 March 2014, the revised draft guidance is available below in English only. The document is posted as a full version, and a track changes can be obtained on request from the Secretariat. Further comments and input to the draft guidance are invited prior to October 31 2014.<p>

<div class="expand" title="Guidance on best available techniques and best environmental practices for the recycling and waste disposal of articles containing polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) listed under the Stockholm Convention on POPs"><p>
The document seeks to provide step-by-step guidance to enable Parties to conduct an inventory of Hexabromodiphenyl ether and heptabromodiphenyl ether, Tetrabromodiphenyl ether and pentabromodiphenyl ether (and HBB) listed under the Convention in 2009. The inventory should provide Parties with baseline data on these substances at national level. Such data would be the basis for Parties to develop strategies/action plans in order to comply with their obligations under the Convention. 
<p>
Main target audience<br>
This document will be useful for national focal points in the Convention, the coordinator of the NIP review and update process, and task teams responsible for the inventory. It will also be of interest to stakeholders concerned with the elimination of PBDEs and HBB.

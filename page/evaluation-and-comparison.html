	<h1>Assess and compare alternatives</h1>
	<p>
		When the alternatives to the use of dangerous chemicals are duly identified, they must be compared and assessed to select the most adequate substance to be used in the production process.
	</p>
	<p>
		Methods and tools to compare alternative by their level of risk include:

				designed to provide information on tools that can be used in conducting chemical substitutions or alternatives assessments. Is an approach for evaluating a chemical, material, process, product, and/or technology for attribute analysis within a chemical substitution/alternatives assessment.

				is a screening method developed by the Dutch Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and Environment as part of a new Chemicals policy to ensure that the potential risks and hazards associated with the use of substances in each stage of their life cycle are sufficiently controlled so as to remove, or to reduce to a negligible level, any harmful effects caused by substances on man or the environment.

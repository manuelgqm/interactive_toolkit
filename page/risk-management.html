<h1>Step 4: Risk management</h1>
<p>Decision-making process involving  considerations of political, social, economic, and technical factors with  relevant risk assessment information relating to a hazard so as to develop,  analyze, and compare regulatory and non-regulatory options and to select and  implement the optimal decisions and actions for safety from that hazard.<br>

<p>The risks  associated with a potential for harm due to exposure to chemicals have to be identified,  assessed and managed appropriately. The distinction between assessment and management  of risks is a key issue.</p>
<p>Risk assessment  procedure is designed to evaluate, usually quantitatively, the nature and  magnitude of a potential risk. But on its own, risk assessment has limited  value. <br>
  Risk management on  the other hand, is the decision-making process to accept a known or assessed  risk and/or the implementation of actions to reduce the consequences or  probabilities of such an occurrence.</p>
<p>When developing  risk management decision-making strategies, two complementary approaches are  considered, usually in sequence:<br>
<ul><li>effects-oriented  policies: effects on human health and the environment; and</li>
 <li>source-oriented  policies: prevention of effects by controlling releases.</li></ul></p>
<p>The effects of a  chemical on health and the environment via an exposure pathway, for example,  represents the first important parameter. Then suitable exposure standards can be  developed. These standards are then translated into a source-related policy to  control the releases of the chemical to ensure that exposure standards are not  exceeded. Risk management therefore considers both policies.</p>
<p>In more general  terms, risk management decision-making should embody a systematic, and  structured approach to chemical risks, that allows the parties involved to:<br>
<ul><li> identify  risks/problems that need to be eliminated or reduced  to  evaluate;</li>
 <li>  identify ways in  which these risks can be eliminated or, &lsquo;managed&rsquo; to control; and;</li>
<li> decide upon the  most appropriate strategy to achieve reduction of risk to  implement and monitor</li></ul></p>
<p>The risk management  process can also be described as comprising a five-step process, ranging from  identification of the problem to implementation and monitoring control actions.  The process is an iterative one and not a linear sequence of actions. The five  steps have been recognized as an important cyclical process to follow so that  governments can make informed decisions on priority chemicals.</p>

<p>It seeks to identify and  eliminate hazards and the assessment of the urgency to act.<br>
  Risk  assessment is an essential tool for preventing health and environmental  damages.<br>
  An adequate risk  assessment must take into account the following factors</p>
<ul>
  <li>Location of chemical</li>
  <li>Chemical properties</li>
  <li>Environmental conditions necessary for the storage,  use, disposal, etc.</li>
  <li>Sector (where and how it is used)</li>

Develop a risk reduction strategy for all possible uses of the chemical, and along the cycle of use, from production, through industrial and public use, to recycling and disposal.

<div id="rm3" class="dialog" title="Consult with stakeholders">
Consult with stakeholders on risk reduction measures intended to establish the management plan taking into account their needs and priorities.<p>
Key stakeholders: Industries, trade unions, consumer organizations, NGOs, and administrations involved.
</div>

<div id="rm4" class="dialog" title="Define risk  reduction/elimination measures">
  Defining risk reduction measures:<br>
  All stakeholders must <u>ensure</u> a proper <u>management</u> of chemicals at workplaces in terms  of their:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Storage</li>
  <li>Management</li>
  <li>Classification of chemicals by hazards</li>
  <li>Proper labelling</li>
  <li>Training to all individuals who come through chemistry</li>
  <li>Plan of emergency related to chemical risk</li>
</ul>
<p>Planning toxic use reduction implies:<br>
  • A use reduction policy <br>
  • An assessment of how and how much is used and how  much toxic waste is generated <br>
  • A list of economically viable, <u>technical </u>abatement  options <br>
  • An implementation plan</p>
<p>The substitution of hazardous chemicals should be  considered a priority measure whenever possible</p>
</div>

<div id="rm5" class="dialog" title="5. Implement and enforce the measures (monitor, sanctions)">
The implementation of the risk reduction plan  must be based on assessment reports and stakeholders&#39; view.<p>
This gives a way to most appropriate strategy formulation in order to reduce the risk. Decision makers will enforce the plan and carry out continual monitoring to evaluate its efectiveness at national level.

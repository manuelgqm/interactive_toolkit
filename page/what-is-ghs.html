<h1>Global Harmonized System implementation</h1><p>
<h2>What is GHS?</h2><p>
In the last three decades many countries have developed different systems of classification and labelling of substances, so that the same substance produced in different countries had different classifications. For example, sodium molybdate, a pesticide is classified as dangerous in China, as harmful in the EU, as a toxic chemical in Japan, the United States and Canada.<p>
At the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, it was identified the need for a global harmonization of criteria for classification and labelling of substances and mixtures, as well as the communication of hazards to consumers and workers throughout the world, in order to promote sustainable development and international trade. After 12 years of work sponsored by several international organizations, the Committee Economic and Social UN adopted the GHS (Global Harmonized System) in the so called purple book.<p>

<td bgcolor="#e7c8f7">The GHS is a system for standardizing and harmonizing the classification and labelling of chemicals. It is a logical and comprehensive approach to:<p><p>
<ul><li>
defining health, physical and environmental hazards of chemicals;</li>
<li>creating classification processes that use available data on chemicals for comparison with the defined hazard criteria</li>
<li>Communicating hazard information, as well as protective measures, on labels and Safety Data Sheets (SDS).</li></ul>

The GHS is not binding (mandatory), although many countries have adopted it.<p>
Its main objectives are to facilitate international trade in chemicals and to maintain the existing level of protection of human health and environment. The GHS is a United Nations system to identify hazardous chemicals and to inform users about these hazards through standard symbols and phrases on the packaging labels and through safety data sheets (SDS).<p>
 The GHS:<p>
 <ul><li>enhances the protection of people and the environment by providing an internationally comprehensive system for chemical hazard communication;</li>
<li>provides a recognized framework for those countries without an existing system;</li>
<li>reduces the need for duplicative testing and evaluation of chemicals; and</li>
<li>facilitates international trade in chemicals whose hazards have been properly assessed unidentified on an international basis.</li></ul><p><p>

The first edition of the GHS was adopted in December 2002 and published en 2003. It is updated every two years since then. <p><p>
The <a target="_blank" href="resources/ST-SG-AC10-30-Rev5e.pdf">most recent version</a> is the fifth revised edition of the GHS adopted in 2012 and published in 2013:GHS (purple book, 5th Edition, 2013) <p>
<h2>Classification</h2><p>
The classification of a chemical is the process by which it is assigned one or more categories of risk.

<div class="expand" title="Classify a product">

To classify a product must first be identified:<p>

<ul><li>Physicochemical properties</li>
<li>Toxicological properties</li>
<li>Specific health or environmental effects</li></ul><p><p>
Once these properties are identified (using tests and evaluations required by law) the product is assigned the corresponding category of danger, with the phrases of mandatory risk associated with each category.<p>
With the new GHS, H statements are listed in the following ranges:<p>
<ul><li>physical hazards: H200-H299 phrases</li>
<li>health hazards: H300-H399 phrases</li>
<li>environmental hazards: H400-H499 phrases</li></ul><p><p>
Furthermore, it becomes necessary to know the Safety Phrases (S phrases), recently designated as P (precautionary) phrases.<p>
The number of precautionary statements has increased considerably (over 100) and is now much more specific. P phrases are classified into four groups: prevention, response, storage and disposal phrases.<p>
<b>Hazard classes</b> are divided according to the general effects of substances or preparations, which could lead to accidents or damage in general (explosive, flammable, oxidizing, gas pressure, corrosive to metals, etc.), health effects (harmful, irritating, toxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic, etc ...) and environmental effects.<p>
<b>Hazard Categories</b> determines the nature of physical danger to human health or the environment, for example: carcinogenic substances wich induces cancer or increase its incidence.<p>
</div>
<h2>Hazard communication</h2><p>
The main tools of chemical hazard communication are labels and safety data sheets (SDS) that contain the hazard information in the form of hazard pictograms, signal words and other communication elements. The aim of these tools is to provide hazard information in a comprehensible form for chemicals that may pose a health, physical or environmental hazard during regular or emergency handling.<p>

<div class="expand" title="Labelling">
<p>
All packaging of products containing dangerous substances or preparations must be labelled correctly. This obligation includes the packaging which products are decanted from containers or bottles.
</p>
<p>
CContainers with intermediate or remains of transfers, as well as containing any waste must be labelled so as to provide the necessary information on their content and associated dangers.<p>
The label must always adhere to the package, clearly, legibly and indelibly written in the official language of the country. <p>
Label elements are defined in the GHS as one type of information that has been harmonized for use in a label, e.g., pictogram, signal word.<p>
The GHS specifies what label elements should appear on a label by hazard class and hazard category for the harmonized information. It is these requirements that result in the same critical label information being available for a chemical regardless of the country where the product is manufactured in.<p>
The standardized label elements included in the GHS are:<p>
<ul><li><b>Pictograms:</b> A graphical composition that includes a symbol, plus a border, background pattern or colour that is intended to convey specific health, physical and environmental hazard information, assigned to a GHS hazard class and category.</li>
<li><b>Signal Words:</b> &#34;Danger&#34; or &#34;Warning&#34; is used to emphasize hazards and indicate the relative level of severity of the hazard, assigned to a GHS hazard class and category.</li>
<li><b>Hazard Statements:</b> Standard phrases assigned to a hazard class and category that describe the nature of the hazard.</li></ul><p><p>
The harmonized approach to these label elements makes it easier for countries to implement the system and should make it easier for companies to comply with regulations based on the GHS. The prescribed pictograms, signal words, and hazard statements can be readily selected from Annex 1 of the GHS Purple Book. These standardized elements should appear on the GHS label as indicated in the GHS for each hazard class/category in the system. The use of pictograms, signal words or hazard statements other than those that have been assigned to each of the GHS hazards would not be harmonized.<p>
<b>Precautionary Statements and Pictograms</b><p>
Precautionary information supplements the hazard information by briefly providing measures to be taken to minimize or prevent adverse effects from physical, health or environmental hazards. First aid is included in precautionary information. The GHS label should include appropriate precautionary information. Annex 3 of the GHS Purple Book includes precautionary statements and pictograms that can be used on labels.<p>
These include four types of precautionary statements covering prevention, response in cases of accidental spillage or exposure, storage, and disposal. The precautionary statements have been linked to each GHS hazard class and category. The goal is to promote consistent use of precautionary statements. <p>

</div>

<div class="expand" title="Safety Data Sheet"><p>
The Safety Data Sheet (SDS) provides comprehensive information for use in workplace chemical management. Employers and workers use SDS as sources of information about hazards and to obtain advice on safety precautions. The SDS is product related and, usually, is not able to provide information that is specific for any given workplace where the product may be used. However, the SDS information enables the employer to develop an active programme of worker protection measures, including training, which is specific to the individual workplace and to consider any measures that may be necessary to protect the environment. Information in a SDS also provides a source of information for other target audiences such as those involved with the transport of dangerous goods, emergency responders, poison centres, and those involved with the professional use of pesticides and consumers.<p>

<p><b>Using RISKQUIM</b><p>
<img src="img/2015-03-31_104749.jpg"><p>
Functioning of the tool:<p>
<ol>
	<li>IDENTIFY THE SUBSTANCES contained in products (substances or mixtures) to be classified and labelled and add them to the folder MY SUBSTANCES. They may be included in the list of substances with harmonized classification and labelling (tables 3.1 and 3.1, Annex VI of CLP Regulation or may be introduced by users (shown in a different colour)</li>
	<li>This steps allows users to consult the list of substances with harmonized classification and labelling (tables 3.1 and 3.2 of Annex VI of CLP Regulation</li>
	<li>FORMULATE THE PRODUCTS containing the substances or mixtures. If users wish to save and retrieve those products later on, they can do it using the code provided by the system. The system does not require personal data from users</li>
	<li>RECOMMENDED LABELLING for the selected product is provided in strict observance of the classification and labelling criteria established by EU Regulation 1272/2008 based on composition (data on harmonized or self-classified substances) and possible uses</li>
</ol>
Note: CLP stands for "Classification, Labelling and Packaging"<p>
Regulation (EC) N&#176; 1272/2008 is a European Union regulation which aligns the European Union system of classification, labelling and packaging chemical substances and mixtures to the Globally Harmonised System (GHS)

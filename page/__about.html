	<h1>About the Toolkit</h1>
	<p>
		At present, most countries have developed satisfactory regulatory frameworks for the management of pesticides, but industrial chemicals remain largely mismanaged. National authorities have limited information on the amounts of industrial chemicals marketed/used in their countries, and lack information about the adverse environmental and health effects associated with their handling. The effective implementation of the Rotterdam and Stockholm Conventions is predicated on a framework for the sound management of industrial chemicals at national level. Countries have emphasized the importance of a technical assistance that would enable them to effectively manage industrial chemicals and comply with their obligations under these Conventions. One of the specific mandates for the Secretariat of the Rotterdam Convention is to support the development of schemes for the management of industrial chemicals in developing countries.

		Considering the importance of an environmentally sound handling of industrial chemicals, this interactive toolkit seeks to provide information and expertise for national/regional stakeholders on the effective implementation of the Rotterdam and Stockholm Conventions. The toolkit is also aimed at increasing countries capacity to implement policies and procedures for the control of industrial chemicals through all the stages of their lifecycle.  Such policies will lead to an enhanced environmental and human protection from the adverse effects caused by these chemicals.

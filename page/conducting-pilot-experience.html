	<h3>Experiment on pilot</h3>
	
	<p>
	First substitution must be tried on a smaller, pilot scale. Tasks needed during the pilot experience are: Plan the technological and organisational changes needed. Pre-evaluate risks with an appropriate methodology. Assess substitution as regards functional performance, impact on workers, environment or consumers. Pay special attention to possible shift of risks and the necessary control measures. Consult employees

		Risk assessment must be carried out during the pilot experiment.
